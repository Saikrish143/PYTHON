# FACIAL-EXPRESSION-TRANSFER-FOR-IMAGE-ANIMATION-BASED-ON-NEURAL-NETWORKS
Nowadays deep learning is developing much faster which will solve many complex problems. Facial expression transfer for image animation is also a deep learning process of generating motion over a static image of a target face based on the changes in the motion of the face in adjacent frames of source video. Facial key points are combined using Generative Adversarial Networks based generator. We will detect and crop the face from the input image by Object Detection technique and using Contrast Limited Adaptive Histogram Equalization we are trying to enhance input as well as predicted output images. By using FFMPEG we are also adding audio to predicted frames and provide a visual as well as audible output from the sources available
